This is a quick port of the Windows cvblobs8.3 library to Linux.

A make file is included which produces the static library: libblob.a

Installation:
-After extracting the files, go into the source directory.
-Command: 
	make
 to compile the source code. The output file is: libblob.a
-Copy this into /usr/local/lib
      su
      <write your root password>
      cp libblob.a /usr/local/lib
      ldconfig
      exit
The command 'ldconfig' registers the new library.

You can also copy all header file to a suitable location such as:
    /usr/local/include/cvblobs
so that they are avilable for all programs.
In that case, change the include lines (for example):
from:
   	#include "BlobResult.h"
to:
	#include <cvblobs/BlobResult.h>
for all of your related source files.

Comment:
There was some major problem with the file:BlobProperties.h 
Some surgery was reuired to make it compilable under g++.
